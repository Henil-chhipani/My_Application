My first android app
Hello guys i am Henil chhipani 
I am student of computer science
few days back started learning android development from code with Harry's video : https://youtu.be/mXjZQX3UzOs
from this i buit this this is very basic app it just take two numbers input from user and add both together.
This is very fascinating to no knowledge of programming to built my own app.
